        Health Icons is a volunteer effort, hosted by public health not-for-profit <Link href="https://resolvetosavelives.org/" target="_blank" >Resolve to Save Lives</Link>. These icons are available in the public domain for use in any type of project.

        <p>
          In 2021, myself and a small group of designers and developers, led by <Link href="https://twitter.com/dburka" target="_blank">Daniel Burka</Link>, created the open-source icon library Heath Icons. Originally intended to replace the <Link href="https://dhis2.org/" target="_blank">DHIS2</Link> icon library, we expanded it and published it independantly for the global good for health projects all over the world.<br/>

      <h3>The Team</h3>
      <p>The team behind Health Icons has grown, but in the early days of the project, there were around 12â€“15 of us working on the first iteration of the library. We were spread across the world, and worked asynchronously, using Figma to collaboratively design the library, and Slack for communication.</p>
      <p>The first iteration of the library went through several auditing and refinement phases as we worked to define a visual language for the icons to share.</p>

      <h3>Project Launch</h3>

      <p>The same week, <Link href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90647428/these-icons-create-a-universal-language-for-healthcare-from-blood-type-to-sex-work" target="_blank">Fast Company wrote about the project</Link> and the team's goals.</p>
      <h3>Project Evolution</h3>
      <p>Since the launch of the project, active design and development has continued. The size of the library has grown to 1198 icons, with more being added every day. </p>
      <p>In July 2021, Health Icons launched a <Link href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/992844281461869440/Health-Icons-Figma-Plugin" target="_blank">Figma plugin</Link> allowing for the search and use of all icons in Figma projects.
